This code suffers from a common error in PHP related to how it handles variable scope within functions and loops.  The issue stems from the use of the `$i` variable in both the loop and the `$array` assignment.   The `$i` variable inside the loop is locally scoped to the `foreach` loop; therefore, after the loop completes, it no longer exists. Consequently, using `$i` after the loop to access an array element leads to an undefined index notice or an unexpected value. 

```php
<?php
$array = array('a', 'b', 'c');
foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
  // Do something with the value...
}
echo $array[$i]; // Notice: Undefined index: i
?>
```
